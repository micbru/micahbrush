I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Lewis Research Group at the University of Alberta in the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences. I am interested in theoretical and spatial ecology, particularly across time and spatial scales. I am currently working on mountain pine beetle dynamics, developing models to study how resistant trees affect their spread, as well as the effects of climate change and warming temperatures. My other projects are in macroecology, studying how speciesâ€™ spatial distributions can be described at large scales.
