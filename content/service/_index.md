Throughout my PhD, I was actively involved with my department, the university, and the broader
academic community. I view service as an integral part of being a member of the academic community. Here is a list of some of my roles during my PhD.

## Leadership
- **Co-coordinator of Respect is Part of Research (2018--2021).** In this role, I led sexual violence and sexual harassment (SVSH) prevention training for graduate students. This program was the first peer-led SVSH prevention training program for graduate students in the United States, with the goal of creating a respectful, positive working environment where everyone can do their best science. During my time as co-coordinator with Wren Suess, we brought our workshop to four new departments, training more than 60 peer facilitators and reaching nearly 300 incoming graduate students each year. We also organized and led a two day workshop in January 2020 called “How To Start A Peer-Led SVSH Prevention Program”, which was attended by 23 graduate students in physics and astronomy representing 9 institutions across the US. Our workshop was positively received and four institutions implemented RPR in Fall 2020: Ohio State, Caltech, Harvard, and Stanford. If you are interested in starting an RPR chapter at your university, [contact me]({{< relref "/#contact" >}}) and I would be happy to help!
- **Physics Delegate for the Graduate Assembly (2017--2019).** I served as one of three physics delegates for two academic years on the [Graduate Assembly](http://ga.berkeley.edu/), the official representative
body of the graduate and professional students, and co-wrote a resolution supporting funding for the mentoring program Berkeley Connect.
- **Co-founder and organizer of the Physics Graduate Student Seminar (2017--2018).** Along with Jonathan Liu, we designed this seminar to provide an opportunity for graduate students to present their work to their peers, and to build community.

## Committees
- UC Berkeley's Coordinated Community Review Team for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Misconduct. Respect is Part of Research representative (2020--2021).
- UC Berkeley Committee on Teaching. Graduate student representative (2017--2020).
- Physics Graduate Admissions Committee. Graduate student representative (2019--2020).
- Physics Graduate Curriculum Committee. Graduate student representative (2018--2019).
- Physics Faculty Search Committee. Graduate student representative (2017).
