I will be teaching at the University of Alberta in Summer 2022.

I am passionate about education, having served as a Graduate Student Instructor four times during my PhD. I had the opportunity to design curriculum and co-lead the development and implementation of tutorial sections for the interdisciplinary problem-solving course ["Sense and Sensibility and Science"](https://sensesensibilityscience.berkeley.edu/), and I was also a GSI for "Origins: From the Big Bang to the Emergence of Humans", and "Introduction to Mathematical Physics". I was also a teaching assistant for 3 different physics courses as an undergraduate student.

Outside of the classroom, I co-wrote a [commentary](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20210623a/full/) for Physics Today about improving graduate education in biophysics. I also served as the sole graduate student representative for three years on the Campus Committee on Teaching, which informs campus teaching policy and evaluates candidates for Distinguished Teaching Awards. 

I also believe that effective mentorship is also a crucial but underappreciated aspect of higher education. In 2017-2018, I served as a mentor for about 40 undergraduates a semester as a [Berkeley Connect](https://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu/) Fellow.
This program connects undergraduates with a PhD student in their field of interest and involves one on one meetings, small group discussions, and field trips. I also directly mentored undergraduate students in my research group during my PhD, including a project where the student published a first-author paper, and another as an applied component of a mentoring course.
